## Project Structure

Our custom ShareX server is organized as a monorepo with the following packages:

### API

The API package contains the server-side code responsible for handling file, image, and text uploads, as well as URL shortening. It provides the core functionality of the ShareX server.

### CLI

The CLI package includes the command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the ShareX server from the terminal. It allows users to perform various actions, such as uploading files, images, or text, and generating short URLs.
