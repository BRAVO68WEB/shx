      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-----------

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - @redis/json@1.0.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @redis/json

This package provides support for the [RedisJSON](https://redisjson.io) module, which adds JSON as a native data type to Redis.  It extends the [Node Redis client](https://github.com/redis/node-redis) to include functions for each of the RedisJSON commands.

To use these extra commands, your Redis server must have the RedisJSON module installed.

## Usage

For a complete example, see [`managing-json.js`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/examples/managing-json.js) in the Node Redis examples folder.

### Storing JSON Documents in Redis

The [`JSON.SET`](https://oss.redis.com/redisjson/commands/#jsonset) command stores a JSON value at a given JSON Path in a Redis key.

Here, we'll store a JSON document in the root of the Redis key "`mydoc`":

```javascript
import { createClient } from 'redis';

...
await client.json.set('noderedis:jsondata', '$', {
  name: 'Roberta McDonald',
  pets: [
    {
    name: 'Rex',
    species: 'dog',
    age: 3,
    isMammal: true
    },
    {
    name: 'Goldie',
    species: 'fish',
    age: 2,
    isMammal: false
    }
  ]
});
```

For more information about RedisJSON's path syntax, [check out the documentation](https://oss.redis.com/redisjson/path/).

### Retrieving JSON Documents from Redis

With RedisJSON, we can retrieve all or part(s) of a JSON document using the [`JSON.GET`]() command and one or more JSON Paths.  Let's get the name and age of one of the pets:

```javascript
const results = await client.json.get('noderedis:jsondata', {
  path: [
    '.pets[1].name',
    '.pets[1].age'
  ]
});
```

`results` will contain the following:

```javascript
 { '.pets[1].name': 'Goldie', '.pets[1].age': 2 }
```

### Performing Atomic Updates on JSON Documents Stored in Redis

RedisJSON includes commands that can atomically update values in a JSON document, in place in Redis without having to first retrieve the entire document.

Using the [`JSON.NUMINCRBY`](https://oss.redis.com/redisjson/commands/#jsonnumincrby) command, we can update the age of one of the pets like this:

```javascript
await client.json.numIncrBy('noderedis:jsondata', '.pets[1].age', 1);
```

And we can add a new object to the pets array with the [`JSON.ARRAPPEND`](https://oss.redis.com/redisjson/commands/#jsonarrappend) command:

```javascript
 await client.json.arrAppend('noderedis:jsondata', '.pets', {
    name: 'Robin',
    species: 'bird',
    age: 1,
    isMammal: false
  });
```

-----------

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - @redis/search@1.1.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @redis/search

This package provides support for the [RediSearch](https://redisearch.io) module, which adds indexing and querying support for data stored in Redis Hashes or as JSON documents with the RedisJSON module.  It extends the [Node Redis client](https://github.com/redis/node-redis) to include functions for each of the RediSearch commands.

To use these extra commands, your Redis server must have the RediSearch module installed.  To index and query JSON documents, you'll also need to add the RedisJSON module.

## Usage

For complete examples, see [`search-hashes.js`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/examples/search-hashes.js) and [`search-json.js`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/examples/search-json.js) in the Node Redis examples folder.

### Indexing and Querying Data in Redis Hashes

#### Creating an Index

Before we can perform any searches, we need to tell RediSearch how to index our data, and which Redis keys to find that data in.  The [FT.CREATE](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/Commands/#ftcreate) command creates a RediSearch index.  Here's how to use it to create an index we'll call `idx:animals` where we want to index hashes containing `name`, `species` and `age` fields, and whose key names in Redis begin with the prefix `noderedis:animals`:

```javascript
await client.ft.create('idx:animals', {
  name: {
    type: SchemaFieldTypes.TEXT,
    SORTABLE: true
  },
  species: SchemaFieldTypes.TAG,
  age: SchemaFieldTypes.NUMERIC
}, {
  ON: 'HASH',
  PREFIX: 'noderedis:animals'
});
```

See the [`FT.CREATE` documentation](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/Commands/#ftcreate) for information about the different field types and additional options.

#### Querying the Index

Once we've created an index, and added some data to Redis hashes whose keys begin with the prefix `noderedis:animals`, we can start writing some search queries.  RediSearch supports a rich query syntax for full-text search, faceted search, aggregation and more.  Check out the [`FT.SEARCH` documentation](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/Commands/#ftsearch) and the [query syntax reference](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/Query_Syntax/) for more information.

Let's write a query to find all the animals where the `species` field has the value `dog`:

```javascript
const results = await client.ft.search('idx:animals', '@species:{dog}');
```

`results` looks like this:

```javascript
{
  total: 2,
  documents: [
    {
      id: 'noderedis:animals:4',
      value: {
        name: 'Fido',
        species: 'dog',
        age: '7'
      }
    },
    {
      id: 'noderedis:animals:3',
      value: {
        name: 'Rover',
        species: 'dog',
        age: '9'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Indexing and Querying Data with RedisJSON

RediSearch can also index and query JSON documents stored in Redis using the RedisJSON module.  The approach is similar to that for indexing and searching data in hashes, but we can now use JSON Path like syntax and the data no longer has to be flat name/value pairs - it can contain nested objects and arrays.

#### Creating an Index

As before, we create an index with the `FT.CREATE` command, this time specifying we want to index JSON documents that look like this:

```javascript
{
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 32,
  coins: 100
}
```

Each document represents a user in some system, and users have name, age and coins properties.

One way we might choose to index these documents is as follows:

```javascript
await client.ft.create('idx:users', {
  '$.name': {
    type: SchemaFieldTypes.TEXT,
    SORTABLE: 'UNF'
  },
  '$.age': {
    type: SchemaFieldTypes.NUMERIC,
    AS: 'age'
  },
  '$.coins': {
    type: SchemaFieldTypes.NUMERIC,
    AS: 'coins'
  }
}, {
  ON: 'JSON',
  PREFIX: 'noderedis:users'
});
```

Note that we're using JSON Path to specify where the fields to index are in our JSON documents, and the `AS` clause to define a name/alias for each field.  We'll use these when writing queries.

#### Querying the Index

Now we have an index and some data stored as JSON documents in Redis (see the [JSON package documentation](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/tree/master/packages/json) for examples of how to store JSON), we can write some queries...

We'll use the [RediSearch query language](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/Query_Syntax/) and [`FT.SEARCH`](https://oss.redis.com/redisearch/Commands/#ftsearch) command.  Here's a query to find users under the age of 30:

```javascript
await client.ft.search('idx:users', '@age:[0 30]');
```

-----------

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - @redis/time-series@1.0.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @redis/time-series

This package provides support for the [RedisTimeSeries](https://redistimeseries.io) module, which adds a time series data structure to Redis. It extends the [Node Redis client](https://github.com/redis/node-redis) to include functions for each of the RedisTimeSeries commands.

To use these extra commands, your Redis server must have the RedisTimeSeries module installed.

## Usage

For a complete example, see [`time-series.js`](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/examples/time-series.js) in the Node Redis examples folder.

### Creating Time Series data structure in Redis

The [`TS.CREATE`](https://oss.redis.com/redistimeseries/commands/#tscreate) command creates a new time series.

Here, we'll create a new time series "`temperature`":

```javascript

import { createClient } from 'redis';
import { TimeSeriesDuplicatePolicies, TimeSeriesEncoding, TimeSeriesAggregationType } from '@redis/time-series';

...

 const created = await client.ts.create('temperature', {
    RETENTION: 86400000, // 1 day in milliseconds
    ENCODING: TimeSeriesEncoding.UNCOMPRESSED, // No compression - When not specified, the option is set to COMPRESSED
    DUPLICATE_POLICY: TimeSeriesDuplicatePolicies.BLOCK, // No duplicates - When not specified: set to the global DUPLICATE_POLICY configuration of the database (which by default, is BLOCK).
  });

    if (created === 'OK') {
    console.log('Created timeseries.');
  } else {
    console.log('Error creating timeseries :(');
    process.exit(1);
  }

```

### Adding new value to a Time Series data structure in Redis

With RedisTimeSeries, we can add a single value to time series data structure using the [`TS.ADD`](https://redis.io/commands/ts.add/) command and if we would like to add multiple values we can use the [`TS.MADD`](https://redis.io/commands/ts.madd/) command.

```javascript

let value = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1; // Random data point value
  let currentTimestamp = 1640995200000; // Jan 1 2022 00:00:00
  let num = 0;

  while (num < 10000) {
    // Add a new value to the timeseries, providing our own timestamp:
    // https://redis.io/commands/ts.add/
    await client.ts.add('temperature', currentTimestamp, value);
    console.log(`Added timestamp ${currentTimestamp}, value ${value}.`);

    num += 1;
    value = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1; // Get another random value
    currentTimestamp += 1000; // Move on one second.
  }

  // Add multiple values to the timeseries in round trip to the server:
  // https://redis.io/commands/ts.madd/
  const response = await client.ts.mAdd([{
    key: 'temperature',
    timestamp: currentTimestamp + 60000,
    value: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1
  }, {
    key: 'temperature',
    timestamp: currentTimestamp + 120000,
    value: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1
  }]);


```

### Retrieving Time Series data from Redis

With RedisTimeSeries, we can retrieve the time series data using the [`TS.RANGE`](https://redis.io/commands/ts.range/) command by passing the criteria as follows:

```javascript

// Query the timeseries with TS.RANGE:
  // https://redis.io/commands/ts.range/
  const fromTimestamp = 1640995200000; // Jan 1 2022 00:00:00
  const toTimestamp = 1640995260000; // Jan 1 2022 00:01:00
  const rangeResponse = await client.ts.range('temperature', fromTimestamp, toTimestamp, {
    // Group into 10 second averages.
    AGGREGATION: {
      type: TimeSeriesAggregationType.AVERAGE,
      timeBucket: 10000
    }
  });

  console.log('RANGE RESPONSE:');
  // rangeResponse looks like:
  // [
  //   { timestamp: 1640995200000, value: 356.8 },
  //   { timestamp: 1640995210000, value: 534.8 },
  //   { timestamp: 1640995220000, value: 481.3 },
  //   { timestamp: 1640995230000, value: 437 },
  //   { timestamp: 1640995240000, value: 507.3 },
  //   { timestamp: 1640995250000, value: 581.2 },
  //   { timestamp: 1640995260000, value: 600 }
  // ]

```

### Altering Time Series data Stored in Redis

RedisTimeSeries includes commands that can update values in a time series data structure.

Using the [`TS.ALTER`](https://redis.io/commands/ts.alter/) command, we can update time series retention like this:

```javascript

  // https://redis.io/commands/ts.alter/
  const alterResponse = await client.ts.alter('temperature', {
    RETENTION: 0 // Keep the entries forever
  });

```

### Retrieving Information about the timeseries Stored in Redis

RedisTimeSeries also includes commands that can help to view the information on the state of a time series.

Using the [`TS.INFO`](https://redis.io/commands/ts.info/) command, we can view timeseries information like this:

```javascript

 // Get some information about the state of the timeseries.
  // https://redis.io/commands/ts.info/
  const tsInfo = await client.ts.info('temperature');

  // tsInfo looks like this:
  // {
  //   totalSamples: 1440,
  //   memoryUsage: 28904,
  //   firstTimestamp: 1641508920000,
  //   lastTimestamp: 1641595320000,
  //   retentionTime: 86400000,
  //   chunkCount: 7,
  //   chunkSize: 4096,
  //   chunkType: 'uncompressed',
  //   duplicatePolicy: 'block',
  //   labels: [],
  //   sourceKey: null,
  //   rules: []
  // }

```

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - extract-files@9.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# extract-files

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/extract-files)](https://npm.im/extract-files) [![CI status](https://github.com/jaydenseric/extract-files/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaydenseric/extract-files/actions)

Clones a value, recursively extracting [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/file), [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/blob) and [`ReactNativeFile`](#class-reactnativefile) instances with their [object paths](#type-objectpath), replacing them with `null`. [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/filelist) instances are treated as [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/file) instance arrays.

Used by [GraphQL multipart request spec client implementations](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#implementations) such as [`graphql-react`](https://npm.im/graphql-react) and [`apollo-upload-client`](https://npm.im/apollo-upload-client).

## Setup

Install with [npm](https://npmjs.com/get-npm):

```shell
npm install extract-files
```

See the [`extractFiles`](#function-extractfiles) documentation to get started.

## Support

- Node.js `^10.17.0 || ^12.0.0 || >= 13.7.0`
- Browsers [`> 0.5%, not OperaMini all, not dead`](https://browserl.ist/?q=%3E+0.5%25%2C+not+OperaMini+all%2C+not+dead)
- React Native

## API

### Table of contents

- [class ReactNativeFile](#class-reactnativefile)
- [function extractFiles](#function-extractfiles)
- [function isExtractableFile](#function-isextractablefile)
- [type ExtractableFile](#type-extractablefile)
- [type ExtractableFileMatcher](#type-extractablefilematcher)
- [type ExtractFilesResult](#type-extractfilesresult)
- [type ObjectPath](#type-objectpath)
- [type ReactNativeFileSubstitute](#type-reactnativefilesubstitute)

### class ReactNativeFile

Used to mark a [React Native `File` substitute](#type-reactnativefilesubstitute) in an object tree for [`extractFiles`](#function-extractfiles). It’s too risky to assume all objects with `uri`, `type` and `name` properties are files to extract.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `file` | [ReactNativeFileSubstitute](#type-reactnativefilesubstitute) | A React Native [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/file) substitute. |

#### Examples

_Ways to `import`._

> ```js
> import { ReactNativeFile } from 'extract-files';
> ```
>
> ```js
> import ReactNativeFile from 'extract-files/public/ReactNativeFile.js';
> ```

_Ways to `require`._

> ```js
> const { ReactNativeFile } = require('extract-files');
> ```
>
> ```js
> const ReactNativeFile = require('extract-files/public/ReactNativeFile');
> ```

_An extractable file in React Native._

> ```js
> import { ReactNativeFile } from 'extract-files';
>
> const file = new ReactNativeFile({
>   uri: uriFromCameraRoll,
>   name: 'a.jpg',
>   type: 'image/jpeg',
> });
> ```

---

### function extractFiles

Clones a value, recursively extracting [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/file), [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/blob) and [`ReactNativeFile`](#class-reactnativefile) instances with their [object paths](#type-objectpath), replacing them with `null`. [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/filelist) instances are treated as [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/file) instance arrays.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `value` | \* | Value (typically an object tree) to extract files from. |
| `path` | [ObjectPath](#type-objectpath)? = `''` | Prefix for object paths for extracted files. |
| `isExtractableFile` | [ExtractableFileMatcher](#type-extractablefilematcher)? = [isExtractableFile](#function-isextractablefile) | The function used to identify extractable files. |

**Returns:** [ExtractFilesResult](#type-extractfilesresult) — Result.

#### Examples

_Ways to `import`._

> ```js
> import { extractFiles } from 'extract-files';
> ```
>
> ```js
> import extractFiles from 'extract-files/public/extractFiles.js';
> ```

_Ways to `require`._

> ```js
> const { extractFiles } = require('extract-files');
> ```
>
> ```js
> const extractFiles = require('extract-files/public/extractFiles');
> ```

_Extract files from an object._

> For the following:
>
> ```js
> import { extractFiles } from 'extract-files';
>
> const file1 = new File(['1'], '1.txt', { type: 'text/plain' });
> const file2 = new File(['2'], '2.txt', { type: 'text/plain' });
> const value = {
>   a: file1,
>   b: [file1, file2],
> };
>
> const { clone, files } = extractFiles(value, 'prefix');
> ```
>
> `value` remains the same.
>
> `clone` is:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "a": null,
>   "b": [null, null]
> }
> ```
>
> `files` is a [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) instance containing:
>
> | Key     | Value                        |
> | :------ | :--------------------------- |
> | `file1` | `['prefix.a', 'prefix.b.0']` |
> | `file2` | `['prefix.b.1']`             |

# Generic Pool

## About

  Generic resource pool with Promise based API. Can be used to reuse or throttle usage of expensive resources such as database connections.



**V3 upgrade warning**

Version 3 contains many breaking changes. The differences are mostly minor and I hope easy to accommodate. There is a very rough and basic [upgrade guide](https://gist.github.com/sandfox/5ca20648b60a0cb959638c0cd6fcd02d) I've written, improvements and other attempts most welcome.

If you are after the older version 2 of this library you should look at the [current github branch](https://github.com/coopernurse/node-pool/tree/v2.5) for it.


## History

The history has been moved to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)


## Installation

```sh
$ npm install generic-pool [--save]
```


## Example

Here is an example using a fictional generic database driver that doesn't implement any pooling whatsoever itself.

```js
const genericPool = require("generic-pool");
const DbDriver = require("some-db-driver");

/**
 * Step 1 - Create pool using a factory object
 */
const factory = {
  create: function() {
    return DbDriver.createClient();
  },
  destroy: function(client) {
    client.disconnect();
  }
};

const opts = {
  max: 10, // maximum size of the pool
  min: 2 // minimum size of the pool
};

const myPool = genericPool.createPool(factory, opts);

/**
 * Step 2 - Use pool in your code to acquire/release resources
 */

// acquire connection - Promise is resolved
// once a resource becomes available
const resourcePromise = myPool.acquire();

resourcePromise
  .then(function(client) {
    client.query("select * from foo", [], function() {
      // return object back to pool
      myPool.release(client);
    });
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    // handle error - this is generally a timeout or maxWaitingClients
    // error
  });

/**
 * Step 3 - Drain pool during shutdown (optional)
 */
// Only call this once in your application -- at the point you want
// to shutdown and stop using this pool.
myPool.drain().then(function() {
  myPool.clear();
});

```


## Documentation



### Creating a pool

Whilst it is possible to directly instantiate the Pool class directly, it is recommended to use the `createPool` function exported by module as the constructor method signature may change in the future.

### createPool

The createPool function takes two arguments:

- `factory` :  an object containing functions to create/destroy/test resources for the `Pool`
- `opts` : an optional object/dictonary to allow configuring/altering behaviour of the `Pool`

```js
const genericPool = require('generic-pool')
const pool = genericPool.createPool(factory, opts)
```

**factory**

Can be any object/instance but must have the following properties:

- `create` : a function that the pool will call when it wants a new resource. It should return a Promise that either resolves to a `resource` or rejects to an `Error` if it is unable to create a resource for whatever reason.
- `destroy`: a function that the pool will call when it wants to destroy a resource. It should accept one argument `resource` where `resource` is whatever `factory.create` made. The `destroy` function should return a `Promise` that resolves once it has destroyed the resource.


optionally it can also have the following property:

- `validate`: a function that the pool will call if it wants to validate a resource. It should accept one argument `resource` where `resource` is whatever `factory.create` made. Should return a `Promise` that resolves a `boolean` where `true` indicates the resource is still valid or `false` if the resource is invalid.

_Note: The values returned from `create`, `destroy`, and `validate` are all wrapped in a `Promise.resolve` by the pool before being used internally._

**opts**

An optional object/dictionary with the any of the following properties:

- `max`: maximum number of resources to create at any given time. (default=1)
- `min`: minimum number of resources to keep in pool at any given time. If this is set >= max, the pool will silently set the min to equal `max`. (default=0)
- `maxWaitingClients`: maximum number of queued requests allowed, additional `acquire` calls will be callback with an `err` in a future cycle of the event loop.
- `testOnBorrow`: `boolean`: should the pool validate resources before giving them to clients. Requires that `factory.validate` is specified.
- `acquireTimeoutMillis`: max milliseconds an `acquire` call will wait for a resource before timing out. (default no limit), if supplied should non-zero positive integer.
- `destroyTimeoutMillis`: max milliseconds a `destroy` call will wait for a resource before timing out. (default no limit), if supplied should non-zero positive integer.
- `fifo` : if true the oldest resources will be first to be allocated. If false the most recently released resources will be the first to be allocated. This in effect turns the pool's behaviour from a queue into a stack. `boolean`, (default true)
- `priorityRange`: int between 1 and x - if set, borrowers can specify their relative priority in the queue if no resources are available.
                         see example.  (default 1)
- `autostart`: boolean, should the pool start creating resources, initialize the evictor, etc once the constructor is called. If false, the pool can be started by calling `pool.start`, otherwise the first call to `acquire` will start the pool. (default true)
- `evictionRunIntervalMillis`: How often to run eviction checks. Default: 0 (does not run).
- `numTestsPerEvictionRun`: Number of resources to check each eviction run.  Default: 3.
- `softIdleTimeoutMillis`: amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction by the idle object evictor (if any), with the extra condition that at least "min idle" object instances remain in the pool. Default -1 (nothing can get evicted)
- `idleTimeoutMillis`: the minimum amount of time that an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction due to idle time. Supercedes `softIdleTimeoutMillis` Default: 30000
- `Promise`: Promise lib, a Promises/A+ implementation that the pool should use. Defaults to whatever `global.Promise` is (usually native promises).

### pool.acquire

```js
const onfulfilled = function(resource){
	resource.doStuff()
	// release/destroy/etc
}

pool.acquire().then(onfulfilled)
//or
const priority = 2
pool.acquire(priority).then(onfulfilled)
```

This function is for when you want to "borrow" a resource from the pool.

`acquire` takes one optional argument:

- `priority`: optional, number, see **Priority Queueing** below.

and returns a `Promise`
Once a resource in the pool is available, the promise will be resolved with a `resource` (whatever `factory.create` makes for you). If the Pool is unable to give a resource (e.g timeout) then the promise will be rejected with an `Error`

### pool.release

```js
pool.release(resource)
```

This function is for when you want to return a resource to the pool.

`release` takes one required argument:

- `resource`: a previously borrowed resource

and returns a `Promise`. This promise will resolve once the `resource` is accepted by the pool, or reject if the pool is unable to accept the `resource` for any reason (e.g `resource` is not a resource or object that came from the pool). If you do not care the outcome it is safe to ignore this promise.

### pool.isBorrowedResource

```js
pool.isBorrowedResource(resource)
```

This function is for when you need to check if a resource has been acquired from the pool and not yet released/destroyed.

`isBorrowedResource` takes one required argument:

- `resource`: any object which you need to test

and returns true (primitive, not Promise) if resource is currently borrowed from the pool, false otherwise.

### pool.destroy

```js
pool.destroy(resource)
```

This function is for when you want to return a resource to the pool but want it destroyed rather than being made available to other resources. E.g you may know the resource has timed out or crashed.

`destroy` takes one required argument:

- `resource`: a previously borrowed resource

and returns a `Promise`. This promise will resolve once the `resource` is accepted by the pool, or reject if the pool is unable to accept the `resource` for any reason (e.g `resource` is not a resource or object that came from the pool). If you do not care the outcome it is safe to ignore this promise.

### pool.on

```js
pool.on('factoryCreateError', function(err){
  //log stuff maybe
})

pool.on('factoryDestroyError', function(err){
  //log stuff maybe
})
```

The pool is an event emitter. Below are the events it emits and any args for those events

- `factoryCreateError` : emitted when a promise returned by `factory.create` is rejected. If this event has no listeners then the `error` will be silently discarded
  - `error`: whatever `reason` the promise was rejected with.

- `factoryDestroyError` : emitted when a promise returned by `factory.destroy` is rejected. If this event has no listeners then the `error` will be silently discarded
  - `error`: whatever `reason` the promise was rejected with.

### pool.start

```js
pool.start()
```

If `autostart` is `false` then this method can be used to start the pool and therefore begin creation of resources, start the evictor, and any other internal logic.

### pool.ready

```js
pool.ready()
```

Waits for the pool to fully start.

### pool.use

```js

const myTask = dbClient => {
  return new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
    // do something with the client and resolve/reject
    })
}

pool.use(myTask).then(/* a promise that will run after myTask resolves */)
```

This method handles acquiring a `resource` from the pool, handing it to your function and then calling `pool.release` or `pool.destroy` with resource after your function has finished.

`use` takes one required argument:

- `fn`: a function that accepts a `resource` and returns a `Promise`. Once that promise `resolve`s the `resource` is returned to the pool, else if it `reject`s then the resource is destroyed.
- `priority`: Optionally, you can specify the priority as number. See [Priority Queueing](#priority-queueing) section.

and returns a `Promise` that either `resolve`s with the value from the user supplied `fn` or `reject`s with an error.

## Idle Object Eviction

The pool has an evictor (off by default) which will inspect idle items in the pool and `destroy` them if they are too old.

By default the evictor does not run, to enable it you must set the `evictionRunIntervalMillis` option to a non-zero value. Once enable the evictor will check at most `numTestsPerEvictionRun` each time, this is to stop it blocking your application if you have lots of resources in the pool.


## Priority Queueing

The pool supports optional priority queueing.  This becomes relevant when no resources are available and the caller has to wait. `acquire()` accepts an optional priority int which
specifies the caller's relative position in the queue. Each priority slot has it's own internal queue created for it. When a resource is available for borrowing, the first request in the highest priority queue will be given it.

Specifying a `priority` to `acquire` that is outside the `priorityRange` set at `Pool` creation time will result in the `priority` being converted the lowest possible `priority`

```js
// create pool with priorityRange of 3
// borrowers can specify a priority 0 to 2
const opts = {
  priorityRange : 3
}
const pool = genericPool.createPool(someFactory,opts);

// acquire connection - no priority specified - will go onto lowest priority queue
pool.acquire().then(function(client) {
    pool.release(client);
});

// acquire connection - high priority - will go into highest priority queue
pool.acquire(0).then(function(client) {
    pool.release(client);
});

// acquire connection - medium priority - will go into 'mid' priority queue
pool.acquire(1).then(function(client) {
    pool.release(client);
});

// etc..
```

## Draining

If you are shutting down a long-lived process, you may notice
that node fails to exit for 30 seconds or so.  This is a side
effect of the idleTimeoutMillis behavior -- the pool has a
setTimeout() call registered that is in the event loop queue, so
node won't terminate until all resources have timed out, and the pool
stops trying to manage them.

This behavior will be more problematic when you set factory.min > 0,
as the pool will never become empty, and the setTimeout calls will
never end.

In these cases, use the pool.drain() function.  This sets the pool
into a "draining" state which will gracefully wait until all
idle resources have timed out.  For example, you can call:

If you do this, your node process will exit gracefully.

If you know you would like to terminate all the available resources in your pool before any timeouts they might have are reached, you can use `clear()` in conjunction with `drain()`:

```js
const p = pool.drain()
.then(function() {
    return pool.clear();
});
```
The `promise` returned will resolve once all waiting clients have acquired and return resources, and any available resources have been destroyed

One side-effect of calling `drain()` is that subsequent calls to `acquire()`
will throw an Error.

## Pooled function decoration

This has now been extracted out it's own module [generic-pool-decorator](https://github.com/sandfox/generic-pool-decorator)

## Pool info

The following properties will let you get information about the pool:

```js

// How many many more resources can the pool manage/create
pool.spareResourceCapacity

// returns number of resources in the pool regardless of
// whether they are free or in use
pool.size

// returns number of unused resources in the pool
pool.available

// number of resources that are currently acquired by userland code
pool.borrowed

// returns number of callers waiting to acquire a resource
pool.pending

// returns number of maxixmum number of resources allowed by pool
pool.max

// returns number of minimum number of resources allowed by pool
pool.min

```

## Run Tests

    $ npm install
    $ npm test

The tests are run/written using Tap. Most are ports from the old espresso tests and are not in great condition. Most cases are inside `test/generic-pool-test.js` with newer cases in their own files (legacy reasons).

## Linting

We use eslint combined with prettier
